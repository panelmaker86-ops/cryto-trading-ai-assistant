# Strategy Guardian AI

**AI-powered risk and strategy guardian for cryptocurrency traders.**

Strategy Guardian AI monitors your trading in real time: it validates risk rules, detects emotional trading patterns, and enforces your strategy—without placing or closing any trades. Built for traders who want oversight and intelligence, not full automation.

## Overview

Strategy Guardian AI **does not execute trades**. It acts as a watchful layer around your activity:

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Trade Risk Monitor** | Alerts when a trade exceeds your limits (max risk per trade, daily loss, leverage, position size). |
| **Strategy Rule Validator** | Verifies entries and exits against your defined rules (e.g. RSI, support, trend). |
| **Emotional Trading Detector** | Flags revenge trading, overtrading, size increases after losses, and off-hours activity. |
| **Market Risk Scanner** | Warns before entry (volatility spikes, liquidation clusters, funding rates). |
| **AI Trade Feedback** | Post-trade scores and suggestions (entry quality, risk management, strategy compliance). |

Alerts are delivered via **Telegram** or **Discord** and persisted for the dashboard.

## Workflow

1. You open or manage a trade manually on your exchange.
2. The guardian receives the trade via the exchange API or **webhook** (`POST /webhook/trade`).
3. The risk engine evaluates size, leverage, and daily PnL.
4. The strategy validator checks entry/exit rules against your saved settings.
5. The behavior detector looks for emotional or impulsive patterns.
6. Warnings are sent to Telegram/Discord and stored for the dashboard.

---

## Webhook Integration

Send new trade events to run the full guardian pipeline (e.g. from TradingView or your own scripts):

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/webhook/trade \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"exchange":"binance","symbol":"BTCUSDT","side":"long","size":0.01,"entry_price":65000,"leverage":5}'
```

Use this URL as the webhook target in TradingView alerts or when a position is opened.

---

## Dashboard

The React dashboard provides:

- **Alerts** — Real-time feed of all guardian warnings.
- **Risk & Account** — Account balance/equity (Binance/Bybit) and editable risk rules (max risk %, daily loss %, leverage, position %).
- **Trades** — History of trades monitored by the guardian, with candlestick and equity views.

Data is persisted in SQLite by default (or `DATABASE_URL` if set).
